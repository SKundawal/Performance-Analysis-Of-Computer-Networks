# CS549 Performance Analysis Of Computer Network - Assignment 1
### Objective: Design an experiment to measure the delay-throughput characteristics of the connection to an Internet server and to determine the bottleneck.
### Task:
- Use `ping` to determine the delay, compute the throughput using the number of packets, packet size and time taken. If possible, find the route taken and the geographical locations of intermediate routers.  
  Select 3 servers:
  - one within IIT Mandi
  - one in a distant part of India
  - one outside India.  
- Repeat the experiment for each of the servers, and run 3 sets of
experiments at different times of day. Write a script to automatically run the experiments. Use tools such as Python, Perl,   Scilab, OO Calc to analyse the data. Look for correlation between the computed throughput, ping delay and traceroute    information.
- Add a geographical map showing the routes taken
